<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
**Virtual Reality Cognitive Exercises**


Virtual reality (or VR) technology has emerged as a powerful tool in a variety of settings, offering immersive, controllable, and repeatable environments for both clinical interactions and experiements. The initial concept behind this project involved the creation of multiple environments intended to be used as private rooms used for therapy, shared by a professional and a patient. This time, the created environments were leveraged to be used in the design of various cognitive assessment tasks such as object localization and object recgonition. By simulating realistic scenarios in a safe and modifiable setting, VR allows researchers to investigate sensory perception, motor control, spatial navigation, memory, decision-making, and social interaction with high confidence.
